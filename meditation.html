            <h2>How to begin ...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Find yourself a quiet place</li>
                <li>Sit comfortably and relax
                    <hr>
                </li>
                    <p>Meditation can be done in any position: laying down, sat upright, cross legged, just so long as you are comfortable.</p>
                <li>Close your eyes and breathe
                    <hr>
                </li>
                    <p>Begin to focus on your breathing. Starting out, it'll be difficult to quiet your mind, so focusing on every inhale and exhale will really help you to get into that relaxed state.</p>
                <li>Stay here for as long as you feel necessary
                    <hr>
                </li>
                    <p>Meditation is a very personal experience. There is no scrict length of time you must stay here. At any point, you can open your eyes and come back to the world.</p>
                <li>Over time, as you become more comfortable...
                    <hr>
                </li>
                    <p>You'll fall into the state much easier. You can begin to center meditation around certain themes which will allow you to find clarity in situations that present themselves to you in your daily life.</p>
                <li>The more you do this, the easier it will become. 
                </li>
