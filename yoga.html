            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Yoga is a centuries old practice, combining exercise and meditation through movement, flexibility, and balance. Originating in ancient India, it is a <a class='in-text-a' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#:~:text=The%20practice%20of%20yoga%20has,valley%20civilization%20around%203000%20BCE.&text=Yoga%20gurus%20from%20India%20introduced,19th%20and%20early%2020th%20centuries." target='_blank'>philosophical school of Hinduism </a> and has been shown to reduce stress and improve health – both physical and mental. At its creation, yoga practices were written in Sanskrit, a sacred language from South Asia. Nowadays, whilst the names may have changed, the poses and the movements are all very similar to their original texts.</p>
            <h2>Varients</h2>
            <p>The two most common forms of yoga are Hatha and Vinyasa. Hatha focuses on deliberate movements into a pose and holding the position for several breaths. Vinyasa on the other hand is the movement from one pose to the next in a smooth flow following the breath. Both varients build strength and flexibility - but Hatha builds a strong core through holding positions for longer perods of time, whereas Vinyasa improves stamina and flow through constant movement. You can learn more about which practice suits you best <a class='in-text-a' href="https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/hatha-vs-vinyasa#about-hatha-yoga" target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Practicing</h2>
            <p>The beauty of yoga is that all positions can be tailored to meet a persons capabilities. Many aspects of each pose can be modified so that anyone can participate. If you're just starting out, the minimal gear you will require is a yoga mat and possibly yoga blocks, though these are not necessary. As long as you have an place you can practice with enough space around you, you should be fine.
