![4 size view of the website's home page](assets/images/amiresponsive-portfolio1.PNG)

Be Mindful is a mindfulness and meditation website, designed to provide information to the user on how to live a more healthy and positive minded lifestyle through various means. The landing page gives a brief explanation of mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. The meditation page has a 'how to' walkthrough if you are a beginner at the practice and the yoga page goes into detail about the history of the practice, different variations, and links to sites and videos for beginners and intermediates. The site encourages people to get out into nature and signposts where users can find more information.

### Known bugs
- On the meditation page, under 720px width, a white band appeared to the right of the screen that pushed all the content over. Although generally hidden on smaller screen, it could be scrolled to. Using [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend) from Stack Overflow, I added the necessary code into my own to fix the bug.

## Further testing
- The site was tested on Google Chrome using their developer tools and viewed on Firefox and Microsoft Edge to ensure it worked across multiple platforms. The site was also viewed on multiple devices of varying screen sizes.

- Google Chrome's DevTools Lighthouse:
