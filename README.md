# Hello and Welcome!

This is my first project for Code Institute. 

Before you is a mindfulness and meditation website, designed to provide information to the user on how to live a more healthy and positive minded lifestyle through various means. The landing page gives a brief explanation of mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. The meditation page has a 'how to' walkthrough if you are a beginner at the practice. The yoga page goes into detail about the benefits of the practice and links to sites and/or videos for beginners and intermediates. 

## Features

### Existing features

Landing page:  
Images and animations on hover for certain items.

Meditation page: 
Static page with images and list content.

Yoga page:
Layout as intended. Dummy text at the moment.

Nature page:
Three sections: forest, mountains, beach.

### Features to be implimented

Yoga page:

Explanations for why yoga is beneficial for health and possibly links to "how to" websites and/or videos.

All dummy text to be replaced with actual content.
