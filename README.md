# Be Mindful 

![4 size view of the website's home page](assets/images/amiresponsive-portfolio1.PNG)

This is my first project for Code Institute. 
You can view the live site [here](Add site link here).

Be Mindful is a mindfulness and meditation website, designed to provide information to the user on how to live a more healthy and positive minded lifestyle through various means. The landing page gives a brief explanation of mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. The meditation page has a 'how to' walkthrough if you are a beginner at the practice. The yoga page goes into detail about the benefits of the practice and links to sites and/or videos for beginners and intermediates. 

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories           
- First time visitor goals:
  - To be able to find easily accessable information about mindfulness.

  - To find links and/or directions on how to practice meditation and yoga.

  - To easily navigate a website on any device I own.

- Returning visitor goals

  - To easily find my way back to the information I found previously.

  - To be able to share the website with people and have them easily use it without direction from me.

- Frequent user goals

  - To see updates to the website with better information and links.

  - In the future, to be able to participate in discussions revolving around users experience with mindfulness and meditation.



### Design
- Color Scheme
  - Simple, clean, calm, white background with colourful images overlayed to look as though they are floating. 

- Typography
  - An easy to read typeface Barlow is used throughout the site following a calm motif. Dancing Script was used for the logo so that it would stand out against the reast of the site. 

- Imagery
  - Colourful, vibrant images contrasting a white background to elicit calm feelings in the user.

### Landing Page

 ![Landing page](assets/images/home-page.PNG)

- The bottom of the landing page has interactive cards as the user hovers over them giving a little information regarding yoga to encourage the user to learn more by navigating to the relevant page.

- GitHub

### Testing

- The original project was constructed on a laptop with a screen size of 12.3 inches. The code was also put through W3C validators and passed through without any issues.

  - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

  - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

### Known bugs
- On the meditation page, under 720px width, a white band appeared to the right of the screen that pushed all the content over. Although generally hidden on smaller screen, it could be scrolled to. Using [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend) from Stack Overflow, I added the necessary code into my own to fix the bug.

### Further testing
- The site was tested on Google Chrome using their developer tools and viewed on Firefox and Microsoft Edge to ensure it worked across multiple platforms. The site was also viewed on multiple devices of varying screen sizes.

- Google Chromes DevTools Lighthouse:
  - Desktop
