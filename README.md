![4 size view of the website's home page](assets/images/amiresponsive-portfolio1.PNG)

Be Mindful is a mindfulness and meditation website, designed to provide information to the user on how to live a more healthy and positive minded lifestyle through various means. The landing page gives a brief explanation of mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. The meditation page has a 'how to' walkthrough if you are a beginner at the practice and the yoga page goes into detail about the history of the practice, different variations, and links to sites and videos for beginners and intermediates. The site encourages people to get out into nature and signposts where users can find more information.

## Testing

- The original project was constructed on a laptop with a screen size of 12.3 inches. The code was also put through W3C validators and passed through without any issues.

  - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fryan-b1yth.github.io%2Fbe-mindful%2F)

  - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fryan-b1yth.github.io%2Fbe-mindful%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Known bugs
- On the meditation page, under 720px width, a white band appeared to the right of the screen that pushed all the content over. Although generally hidden on smaller screen, it could be scrolled to. Using [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend) from Stack Overflow, I added the necessary code into my own to fix the bug.

- On all pages except the landing page and the nature page, at certain screen sizes the page would collapse, bringing the footer to the base of the header leaving the rest of the page to 'spill out' below. Various attempts were made to try and fix this to have the page respond in the same way to the landing page however none seemed to work. Finally, specific div element sizes were altered manually in the media quieries which fixed the issue but isn't an elegant solution. Dispite 'fixed', I will return to this to improve the fix at a later date.

## Further testing
- The site was tested on Google Chrome using their developer tools and viewed on Firefox and Microsoft Edge to ensure it worked across multiple platforms. The site was also viewed on multiple devices of varying screen sizes.

- Google Chrome's DevTools Lighthouse:

  - Mobile

## Deployment 
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
