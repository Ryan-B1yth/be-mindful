# Hello and Welcome!

![4 size view of the website's home page](assets/images/amiresponsive-portfolio1.PNG)

This is my first project for Code Institute. 

Before you is a mindfulness and meditation website, designed to provide information to the user on how to live a more healthy and positive minded lifestyle through various means. The landing page gives a brief explanation of mindfulness, meditation, and yoga. The meditation page has a 'how to' walkthrough if you are a beginner at the practice. The yoga page goes into detail about the benefits of the practice and links to sites and/or videos for beginners and intermediates. 

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories           
- First time visitor goals:
  - To be able to find easily accessable information about mindfulness.

  - To find links and/or directions on how to practice meditation and yoga.

  - To easily navigate a website on any device I own.

### Returning visitor goals

  - To easily find my way back to the information I found previously.

  - To be able to share the website with people and have them easily use it without direction from me.

### Frequent user goals

  - To see updates to the website with better information and links.

  - In the future, to be able to participate in discussions revolving around users experience with mindfulness and meditation.



### Design
- Color Scheme
  - Simple, clean, calm, white background with colourful images overlayed to look as though they are floating. 

- Typography
  - An easy to read typeface used throughout following the calm motif.

- Imagery
  - Colourful, vibrant images depicting various scenes to elicit calm feelings in the user.
